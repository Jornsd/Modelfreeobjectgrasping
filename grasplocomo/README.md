# GraspLoCoMo - Model-free & Learning-free robotic grasping

## About

GraspLoCoMo is a C++ software package used for robotic grasp generation. It allows to generate grasps for parallel jaw-grippers given a 3D point cloud with normals. This implementation is based on the results from the publication [Model-free and learning-free grasping by Local Contact Moment matching](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594226).

## Installation

### Software Requirements
GraspLoCoMo requires the following software:

* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
  
and the following mandatory libraries
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
* [Nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann)

**Note** Eigen and Nanoflann are headers-only libraries and can be easily integrated using CMake. Both are added as git submodules in the ThirdParty folder.

**Windows:** 
Install Visual Studio and CMake. Clone/Download Eigen and Nanoflann in the **_ThirdParty_** folder. 
In the CMakeLists.txt file, change the value of the variables _EIGEN3_INCLUDE_ and _NANO_FLANN_INCLUDE_ to the path of Eigen and Nanoflann.
Open CMake and configure the project.

```
**Where is the source code** : <Location of GraspLoCoMo>
**Where to build the binaries** : <Location of GraspLoCoMo>/Build	
```
Click on **Configure** and use the following configuration.

```
**Specify the generator for this project** : <Your installed version of visual studio>	
**Optional platform for generator ...** : x64
```
Click on **Finish**. The project can now be generated by clicking on **Generate**. 
The _Build_ folder will contain the Visual Studio solution of the project (GraspLoCoMo.sln).
Open the solution using Visual Studio and set the **TestdxGraspLoCoMo** as StartUp Project. Select **Release**, **x64** if not already set. And click run to execute the code.

**_Note (Release mode):_** By default the project will be in Debug mode. For some reason the execution of the code is much slower in this mode, set the poject to Release to get better performances. This will be fixed in future!!

**_Note for Linux:_** The code has been tested with Ubuntu 20.04.4 and cmake (without Visual Studio).

### Folder Structure
- Grasp: LoCoMo Grasping code
  - include: Folder containing the include files
  - src: Folder containing the source files of the method
  - test: Code that can be used to test the method
- Clouds: Example point clouds
- Core: Utility modules and functions
- ThirdParty: Empty folder where the required libraries are installed

To compile, you need to:

    Clone the repository
    Open a terminal and change directory: cd grasplocomo
    Run
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    Once the modules are installed, run
    cmake .
    make

And you will have in the /lib folder the built library libdxGraspLoCoMo.a, and the file at /Grasp/dxTestGraspLoCoMo that you can execute for a demonstration of the algorithm. You will need to move the folder /Clouds a level up ../grasplocomo for the point clouds to be found or change the location of the folder in /grasp/test/dxGraspLoCoMoTest.cpp (line 96).
